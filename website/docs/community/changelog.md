EventCatalog uses [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) and [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage releases of the packages.

Each package under the monorepo is released separately and automated using changesets and GitHub Actions.

Each package has it's own changelog which you can find in the [packages directory](https://github.com/boyney123/eventcatalog/tree/master/packages)

Example: [create-eventcatalog changelog](https://github.com/boyney123/eventcatalog/blob/master/packages/create-eventcatalog/CHANGELOG.md)
